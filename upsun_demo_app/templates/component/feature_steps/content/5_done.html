<p class="mb-2 mt-2 font-bold">ðŸŽ‰ Kudos! You've aced the Upsun Demo!</p>
<p class="mb-2">You've just experienced the power of Upsun's Git-based workflow to stage and
    deploy Redis seamlessly.</p>
<p class="mb-2 mt-5">
    <span>You've used the Upsun CLI to merge a new service into production, and to match the resources you worked with in staging to that environment. From here, you can <strong>scale those resources</strong> to whatever you need. For example, at this moment your production Redis service has 0.5 CPU. You can scale down the amount of resources on the production Redis service container with the following command:</span>
    {{ feature_step_macros.copy_button("upsun resources:set \\\n\t--size redis_service:0.1 \\\n\t--disk upsun-demo:0 \\\n\t-e main",
                block=True
            ) }}
</p>
<p class="mb-2 mt-5"><span>Delete this project when ready using:</span>
    {{ feature_step_macros.copy_button("upsun project:delete") }}
